the Vyne

We decided to name our app "the Vyne" due to vines in everyday life as being symbols
or representations of interconnectedness and and infinite strands.  We viewed "reddit"
as an aggregator site bringing together a wide array and assortment of user content.
Our general approach to this project was to first decide on a simple layout for the
landing page and then to work on functions of the api and to leave the styling of
the page for last.  This seemed like a natural progression because although the
api rules were the most unfamiliar lesson to implement and also potentially the most difficult,
we also agreed that we needed a framework for the project page in order to ground us and direct us
where to stick our code.  We began brainstorming ideas for the page layout during the first weekend
after the project was assigned.  In the beginning we were only going to have one page on which all
the links and requirements were visible because that seemed simplest but as we began to work,
we discovered it really wasn't so complicated to have multiple landing pages.
We began working on the api directions on the first Monday and tried to divide the number of requirements
into 4, wanting to finish by the following Thursday.  We knew we wanted to reserve the Thursday before the
Friday due date for the inspection and resolution of bugs.  We fully expected functional errors but we under-
estimated how pesky they can be and also did not realize that sometimes you cannot hold a bug in "waiting"
as it can impact the functioning of other necessary commands.  In actuality, one of the most challenging
aspects of this project was the discovery that something we took for granted as fully functional suddenly
"tinkered out."  It can feel like days and days of work were lost. We learned right from the start to
always save a copy of file code somewhere else--I used a notepad text program.  We just did not trust
github as a reliable repository of our code.  It caused more problems and pains with strange insertions
 of text when we were trying to merge and refusing to accept changes.  Maybe we just were not adept at
 understanding what it wanted. Once we decided that we would have a log in page that was separate from the
 homepage, we started making strides.  Overall, we learned the importance of breaking problems into smaller,
 manageable steps.  Also, try to identify the most difficult or complex aspect of a project and
associate some kind of timeline to it, keeping in mind that there is always the element of the unknown
when it comes to coding, and you must be able to adapt to changes required due to new problems arising.
