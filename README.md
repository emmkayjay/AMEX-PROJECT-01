Our approach

We decided to first create a general template of the layout for the homepage.  We sectioned the page into different divs and colors.  

We decided to check how the email function would fit into one of the divs.  It fit successfully into the sidebar.

In the beginning, we could not merge branches with master git repositories and learned how to review and fix discrepancies.  This took up a lot of time and was challenging at first.

We decided to do the most vital function first which was the Login. We're not sure if login is supposed to be fully functional.  We created a function based on the POST request.
